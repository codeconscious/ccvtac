# TODOs and Ideas

Features that I might consider as features or improvements in the future. Not all ideas might be viable, or even _good_, but this helps me avoid forgetting them.

- Changing, saving, and reloading of settings while running the program.
- JSON history that stores more data than just URLs?
- Possible to include yt-dlp as a binary? (Even if so, does it make sense to?)

## Rejected

(None yet.)
