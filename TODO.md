# TODOs and Ideas

Features that I might consider as features or improvements in the future. Not all ideas might be viable, or even _good_, but this helps me avoid forgetting them until I decide what to do.


- Add audio normalization (I need to find a command line tool or NuGet package that works with M4A files)
- Add a post-processingâ€“only option for already-downloaded temporary files (via aborted downloads, etc.)
- Stop downloading if there are repeated errors from yt-dlp
- Logging levels (current/full vs. light)
- Logging to a file
- JSON history that stores more data than just URLs (Or maybe the log file would be sufficient? If so, is the history file even needed? Maybe allow up-and-down scrolling through history?)
- yt-dlp can handle tabs on YouTube channels too, so look into supporting those
- Changing, saving, and reloading of settings while running the program
- Save errors to a file with details
- Possible to include yt-dlp as a binary? (Even if so, does it make sense to?)
- Count generated files for final output
- Don't show Topic urls in tag comments because they are empty (Double-check this)
- Set up actual releases
