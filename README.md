# CCVTAC

CCVTAC (CodeConscious Video-to-Audio Converter) is a small .NET-powered CLI tool that acts as a wrapper around [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to enable even easier downloads of M4A audio from specific YouTube videos, playlist, and channels, plus do some automatic post-processing (tagging and moving) as well.

Feel free to use it yourself, but please do so responsibly. No warranties or guarantees provided!

## Features

- Converts YouTube videos to local M4A audio files (via [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp))
- Supports video, playlist, and channel URLs
- Adds video metadata (channel name, channel URL, video URL, etc.) summary to Comment tags
- Writes ID3 tags (artists, title, etc.) to files where possible (via metadata or regex-based detection)
- Renames files via specified regex patterns (to remove resource IDs, etc.)
- Optionally auto-trims and writes video thumbnails to files as album art (if [mogrify](https://imagemagick.org/script/mogrify.php) is installed)
- Customize behavior via a user settings file
  - Optionally split video chapters into separate files
  - Specify the working directory for temporary files
  - Specify an output directory for audio files
  - List channels for whom video upload years should _not_ be added to the tags' Year field (Adding years is the default behavior)
  - Set sleep times between batches (multiple URLs entered at once) and individual video downloads
- Saves entered URLs to a local history file

## Running It

Prerequisites:

- [.NET 8 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) (at least until I prepare actual releases...)
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
- Optional: [mogrify](https://imagemagick.org/script/mogrify.php) (for auto-trimming album art)

Run the program with `dotnet run`. Pass `-h` or `--help` for the instructions.

If your `settings.json` file does not exist, it will created in the application directory with default settings. At minimum, you will need to enter paths to two existing directories: (1) a working directory for temporary files, (2) the directory to which the final audio files should be moved, and (3) a path to a history file. The other settings are optional.

Once the program is running, simply enter at least one YouTube video, playlist, or channel URL at the prompt and press Enter.

Recommended: Periodically ensure you're running the latest version of yt-dlp using `sudo yt-dlp -U` (or whatever command is appropriate for your systemâ€”see the [yt-dlp GitHub page](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#update) for more), especially if you start experiencing download errors.
